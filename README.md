# To Do List

This is a basic level javascript project. I have not focused more on UI design rather I built this just for the purpose of making use of concepts I have learned. More importantly, I wanted to apply the knowledge of localStorage, so I did this project.

## Features

- Responsive
- Single click on li to check(for finished task) and double click to remove check
- your list is stored in localStorage, so it won't get removed unless you click the clear button
